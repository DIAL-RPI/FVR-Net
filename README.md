# Frame-to-Volume Registration Network (FVR-Net)
This repository contains the source code for MICCAI-2021 paper, entitled "End-to-end Ultrasound Frame to Volume Registration". 

# Introduction
In this work, the proposed FVR-Net can be trained to automatically register a single transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) 2D frame to a reconstructed 3D TRUS volume, which potentially enables instant localization during the prostate biopsy. We include the training codes for the current version, and the repository is under active update.
